#### Hi, I’m @vaughankraska
- I’m interested in software and data engineering. Big fan of neovim and most recently nuked windows off my desktop for linux. My education was in quantitative methods related to finance, data science, and economics. I am happy to contribute to any interesting projects. I have thorough experience with java, python, and typescript.
- My experience (in no particular order) includes:
  - Writing libraries
  - Next JS/React
  - Building REST/GRAPHQL services for SQL databases
  - Writing portfolio optimization scripts using linear programming and differential evolution algorithms.
  - Lil bit of Rust
  - Data science (a masters degree actually)
  - Data Engineering: cloud environments, docker, ray, etc.
