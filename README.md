- Hi, I’m @vaughankraska
- I’m interested in quantitative methods related to finance, data science, and economics. I am also a web developer and am happy to contribute to any interesting projects. I have experience with java, node, and bootstrap.
- I have experience:
  - Writing portfolio optimization scripts using linear programming and differential evolution algorithms.
  - Backtesting forecasting models such as GARCH and EWMA
  - Monte Carlo simulation for stocks using stochastic volatilities
  - Pricing derivatives
  - Retrieving data from websites using Selenium
- I could be looking to collaborate on autotrading and investment agorithms.
