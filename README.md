#### Hi, I’m @vaughankraska
- I’m interested in software and data engineering. Big fan of neovim and desktop linux. My education was in quantitative methods related to finance, data science, and economics and then I got a Master's in Data Science that focused on distributed systems and ML. I am happy to contribute to any interesting projects - I am easily excited about building anything. I have thorough experience with java, python, and typescript.
- My experience (in no particular order) includes:
  - Writing libraries
  - Distributed training in PyTorch
  - Next JS/React
  - Building REST/GRAPHQL services with SQL databases
  - Writing portfolio optimization scripts using linear programming and differential evolution algorithms.
  - Lil bit of Rust
  - Data science (more generally)
  - Data Engineering: cloud environments, docker, ray, etc.
