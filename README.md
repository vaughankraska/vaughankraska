- Hi, I’m @vaughankraska
- I’m interested in quantitative methods related to finance and investing.
- I have experience:
  - Writing portfolio optimization scripts using linear programming and differential evolution algorithms.
  - Backtesting forecasting models such as GARCH and EWMA
  - Monte Carlo simulation for stocks using stochastic volatilities
  - Pricing derivatives
  - Retrieving data from websites using Selenium
- I could be looking to collaborate on autotrading and investment agorithms.
